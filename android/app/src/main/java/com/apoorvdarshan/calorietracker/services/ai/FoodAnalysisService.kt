            - TDEE = BMR * (activity multiplier + training-program adjustment). Activity multipliers: sedentary 1.2, light 1.375, moderate 1.465, active 1.55, very active 1.725, extra active 1.9. Program adjustments: active recovery 0.0, full body 0.025, upper/lower 0.04, push/pull/legs/upper/lower 0.055.
            - Calorie target = TDEE + adjustment. adjustment = 0 for maintain; lose: -(weeklyChangeKg*7700/7); gain: +(weeklyChangeKg*7700/7).
            - Guarded empirical maintenance: for a matching 14/28/90-day window, maintenance ≈ average likely-complete intake − (weightChangeKg × 7700 ÷ weightSpanDays). Use only when evidence confidence is medium/high, at least half the window is likely-complete, there are at least 2 weigh-ins spanning 14+ days, and the implied trend is physiologically plausible. Never use partial/missing intake, never divide by the nominal window when the reported weight span differs, and ignore this estimate when those guards fail. Priority: measured Energy Burn anchor when available; otherwise a well-supported empirical estimate; otherwise formula TDEE.

You may choose a value within about ±15% based on the weight goal and observed history (lean toward the higher end during a calorie deficit to preserve muscle). Do NOT reinterpret these as lean-mass rates or scale protein down just to fit a lower calorie target.
