# Release notes

Historical summaries below are preserved from the store copy at each release tag,
with early Android summaries reconstructed from the corresponding changes.
They describe those versions, not necessarily the current product. Tags with the
same marketing version can share a feature summary while identifying different builds.

## Unreleased

No iPhone release tag yet. The ios-v7.1 notes below are the prepared store copy for iOS build 38.

## android-v7.1.1

Fud AI 7.1.1 for Android removes the beta signup and keeps the 7.1 update.

IMPROVED

NEW
• Weekly Challenge standings show a podium for 1st–3rd, your week as progress bars, and 20 places per page (#1–#20, then #21–#40). Everyone gets their own place.

• Android can use the in-app language picker.

IMPROVED
• Onboarding names the API key after the provider you choose and asks you to accept Terms before continuing.

## v4.4-build25

Fud AI 4.4 — Smarter, AI-powered goals.

NEW
• Recalculate Goals now uses AI. It sets your daily calories and macros from your profile — and as you keep logging, refines them from your real intake and weight trend (a true "hit and trial" estimate of your maintenance). Works with Fud AI Premium or your own provider key, and falls back to the standard formula when AI isn't available.
• Recalculate also refreshes your optional nutrient targets — fiber, sugar, sodium, and more.
• Onboarding now sets up your AI up front (Premium, or bring your own provider, model, and key) and builds your starting plan with AI.
• Lock any calculated calorie or macro target so Recalculate and Adaptive keep it fixed — reset to auto-balance anytime.
• New optional body measurements (waist, hips, neck, and more) in Settings → Personal Info feed Recalculate Goals and the Coach.

IMPROVED
• Energy Burn Goals is now part of Adaptive Goals — one simpler toggle. When Apple Health is connected, your weekly auto-correction also factors the calories you actually burned.
• Swipe left or right on the calorie area of Home to move between days; the week strip follows along.
• Coach replies now render formatted text — headings, bold, and bullet lists — so guidance is easier to read.
• Weight goals read clearer: Lose / Cutting, Maintain / Recomp, and Gain / Bulking.
• Get notified when a new version is available, with an App Updates toggle in Notifications.
• Food log times now follow your phone's 12- or 24-hour clock.
• General refinements and fixes.

No data migration is required. Existing logs, goals, widgets, Premium, and BYOK settings are preserved.

## android-v2.3.0

• Recalculate Goals is now AI-powered — it sets your calories and macros from your profile and refines them from your logged intake and weight trend. Falls back to the standard formula offline.
• Onboarding now sets up your AI provider and key, then builds your starting plan with AI.

## android-v2.2.2

• Text food entry keeps the keyboard open while examples rotate.
• Native Android voice now falls back when on-device language support is missing. Try Groq (Whisper) or Deepgram for more consistent transcription.

## v4.3-build24

Fud AI 4.3 — Apple Intelligence fallback and Polish localization fixes.

NEW
• Text, voice-transcribed, and Siri food logging now try the active AI access path first: Premium Gemini, or your BYOK provider plus configured fallback.
• On supported iPhones, Apple Intelligence can run as a final on-device fallback when those provider attempts fail.
• Apple Intelligence fallback keeps the existing serving-unit review behavior and skips unsupported scripts.
• Photo scans, nutrition label scans, and Coach continue using the configured AI access path.
• Polish now covers dynamic nutrient names, meal types, Settings labels, and locale-aware date/time display.
• Polish "Log" wording has been corrected to "Dodaj" / "Dodaj wagę" where appropriate.

No data migration is required. Existing logs, goals, widgets, Premium, and BYOK settings are preserved.

## v3.3-build8

Fud AI 3.3 — better voice language control, smoother food edits, and in-app update checking.

NEW
• Speech-to-text language selection — each STT provider now has its own language setting. Native iOS defaults to Use iPhone Language; AI providers keep Provider Auto unless a specific language is selected.
• Provider-specific voice hints — OpenAI Whisper, Groq Whisper, Deepgram, and AssemblyAI receive the selected language where their API supports it, helping non-English meal dictation land closer to what you said.
• About update check — About now shows your installed version, checks the App Store version, shows a dot when an update is available, and opens the App Store update page from the app.

Polish
• Faster quantity correction in Review Food — the cursor starts at the end of the amount, the clear button keeps the field focused, and the numeric keyboard gets a Done button.
• The Edit Food screen gets the same quantity keyboard polish as Review Food.

## v3.2

Fud AI 3.2 — body fat tracking, Coach reaches your full history, and smart daily reminders.

NEW
• Body fat tracking — log readings over time, set a goal %, see your composition trend on the Progress chart alongside weight. Optional: only shown if you opt in during onboarding or set a value in Settings → Profile.
• Apple Health body fat sync — readings flow both ways with Apple Health. Smart-scale data (Withings, Renpho, Eufy, etc.) auto-imports into Fud AI. First time you enable HK sync, years of historical scale data backfills into the chart.
• Unified Weight / Body Fat chart — segmented toggle on the Progress card lets you flip between metrics. Swipe horizontally on the chart to switch.
• Coach gets your full history — instead of seeing only the last 10 weights or 14 days of food, Coach can now fetch any date range on demand. Ask "what was my weight in March?" or "show me my body fat trend over the last 6 months" and it pulls exactly what it needs.
• Use Body Fat for BMR toggle — non-destructive escape hatch in Settings → Profile. When your body fat reading is stale, flip off to fall back to Mifflin-St Jeor without losing the value.
• Log Weight + Log Body Fat reminders — two new smart daily nudges (Settings → Notifications). Skip firing on days you've already logged. Body fat default off (most people don't measure daily).
• Search saved meals — search bar in the Saved Meals sheet filters Recents / Frequent / Favorites separately.
• Decimal weight pickers — pick 72.4 kg or 158.3 lbs without typing in onboarding's Height & Weight + Goal Weight steps.

Polish
• Onboarding loader is now a single brand-pink gradient (was pink → blue).
• Restacked Onboarding Height & Weight imperial layout so the lbs wheel stops collapsing on narrow columns.
• OpenRouter now defaults to a free vision model so you can test the integration without loading credits.

Bug fixes
• Favorites no longer lose their image when the source food log entry is deleted.
• Gender no longer flips to "Other" for users without a HealthKit biological sex value.
• Photo + text analysis is more reliable — better tolerance for AI responses with prose or markdown around the JSON, fewer "Could not understand the AI response" errors.

• Decimal weight pickers — pick 72.4 kg or 158.3 lbs without typing in onboarding's Height & Weight + Goal Weight steps.
• Custom AI Instructions — optional text box in Settings → AI Provider. Anything you put there (region, dietary preferences, athletic goals, brand preferences) is sent with every AI request, so you don't have to repeat context for every meal.
• Fallback AI Provider — opt-in toggle in Settings → AI Provider. If your primary provider fails (overload, rate limit, network error), the app auto-retries with a second provider you configure. Pair a paid model as primary with a free model as fallback for cheap reliability.
• Calculation Methods — every formula behind your calorie target, BMR, TDEE, and macro split is now documented in-app with peer-reviewed citations (Mifflin-St Jeor, Katch-McArdle, FAO/WHO/UNU activity multipliers, Hall 2011 energy balance, Morton 2018 protein meta-analysis). Reachable from the Plan onboarding step or Settings → Goals & Nutrition.
• AI Analysis Notice — clear in-app prompt before any food photo, voice transcript, or text description is sent to your selected AI provider. Names the provider, lists what's sent, and gives an explicit Allow / Not Now choice.

## v3.1

Fud AI 3.1 — manual entry, a dedicated Protein widget, and Gemini 3.

• Protein widget — track protein progress on its own. 5 sizes (Small, Medium, Circular, Rectangular, Inline) — same families as the Calorie widget. Add both for at-a-glance daily protein + calories without opening the app.

Security: removed the unused legacy authentication manager and moved Gemini API
credentials from URL query parameters to request headers. This addresses the
cleartext storage/transmission issues detected by CodeQL in April 2026.
[Fix details](https://github.com/apoorvdarshan/fud-ai/commit/c0d6c750a).

Fud AI 3.0 — your AI nutrition coach, now in 15 languages.

NEW
• Coach tab — multi-turn AI chat that sees your profile, weight trend, and food log. Ask "expected weight in 30 days?", "how's my protein this week?", "what should I eat tonight?" — it answers in plain English.
• Saved Meals — log a past meal in one tap. Recents, Frequent, and Favorites, with drag-to-reorder and swipe-to-delete.
• Home Screen + Lock Screen widgets — 5 sizes (Small, Medium, Circular, Rectangular, Inline). Update the moment you log a meal — no need to open the app.
• Camera + Note — add a short description to a food photo for sharper AI accuracy.
• Share the App — send Fud AI to a friend in one tap, with a personalized message.
• 15 languages — auto-selected by your iPhone's language setting.

AI + Voice
• 5 new AI providers: Hugging Face, Fireworks AI, DeepInfra, Mistral (Pixtral), and a Custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint. 13 providers total.
• 5 speech-to-text engines: Native iOS, OpenAI Whisper, Groq, Deepgram, AssemblyAI.
• Anthropic refreshed — Claude Sonnet 4.6 default, Opus 4.7, Haiku 4.5.
• Transient provider overloads (503/429/529) retry automatically with exponential backoff — short spikes resolve invisibly.

Apple Health

Polish
• Fixed a silent save failure that could lose newly logged meals on certain accounts.
• Picker sheets open at your current value — no more flash-to-default.

• Delete All Data is local-only — your Apple Health data is yours and never touched.
• Tons of UI polish across Home, Progress, Coach, and Saved Meals.
