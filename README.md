Open-source, privacy-first calorie tracker for iOS and Android. Bring your own AI provider — 13 supported including Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, Grok, Groq, Hugging Face, Fireworks AI, DeepInfra, Mistral, and any custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint — or, on iPhone, optionally use Plus/Pro hosted AI. Capture or import up to 10 food photos with an optional note, scan a barcode, ask your AI coach how to hit your goal, speak your lunch, or use Siri Shortcuts on iOS to log food and weight. On supported iPhones, food-description analysis for text, voice-transcribed, and Siri food logs can use Apple Intelligence on-device as the final fallback after BYOK provider/fallback attempts fail. On iOS 27, Apple Intelligence can also analyze food photos on-device when you select it. The core tracker has no required account, general cloud sync, tracking, or ads. Its sole first-party sync exception for scores and profiles is an optional 18+ Weekly Challenge that shares only a pseudonymous display profile and weekly aggregate scores with other enrolled participants — never raw logs.

This fork adds matching iOS and Android Training Programs, Finnish localization and food recognition, and program-aware calorie and macro targets while preserving local-first BYOK AI access.

Normal updates preserve existing local and Health data.

[Android release APK](https://github.com/yojimbo187-alt/fud-ai/releases/latest/download/ruoka-treeni-android.apk) · [Report an Issue](https://github.com/yojimbo187-alt/fud-ai/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) · [Request a Feature](https://github.com/yojimbo187-alt/fud-ai/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml)

## Features

### Logging
- **Photo & Scan menu** — a focused submenu for Camera, Photos, and Barcode
- **Multi-photo Camera** — keep taking photos, review them horizontally, add an optional note, then analyze up to 10 separate images together
- **iOS Share Extension** — send a food photo from Photos or another app directly into Fud AI for review and logging
- **Barcode lookup** — scan packaged foods on iOS and Android and fill nutrition from Open Food Facts when product data is available
- **Multi-photo library import** — select up to 10 existing images, add an optional note, and analyze them together
- **Text input** — type food descriptions
- **Voice input** — speak your meals hands-free (6 STT options with per-provider language selection, see below)
- **iOS Siri Shortcuts** — say phrases like "Log food in Fud AI", "Calories today in Fud AI", or "Log my weight in Fud AI"; the phrase guide lives under + → Describe Meal → Siri Phrases
- **Manual Entry** — log known calories and macros without AI
- **Smart serving units** — AI can show slices, pieces, cups, ml, or other visible serving units while grams stay the source of truth
- **Review nutrition unlock** — correct calories, macros, and detailed nutrients before logging, then lock again so serving changes scale from your edits
- **Meal What if?** — preview how a reviewed meal changes today's calories and macros, then ask AI for a practical suggestion before logging
- **Saved Meals** — Recents, Frequent, and Favorites with safer swipe actions, search, and drag-to-reorder
- **Retryable analysis** — failed image analysis offers Retry and Cancel without limiting the number of retries

### Intelligence
- **AI Coach tab** — multi-turn chat with memory. Coach can retrieve relevant profile, weight, body-fat, nutrition, workout, and explicitly logged fasting context, then answer questions like "what's my expected weight in 30 days?" or "how did my training go this week?". It never treats a missing meal log as proof that you fasted. Camera/photo attachments work on both platforms. Memory persists across launches; Reset starts a fresh conversation. Long-press any reply to copy.
- **AI Access** — free Bring Your Own Key: pick provider, model, fallback, custom instructions, and speech language directly on device. (The optional Fud AI Premium proxy from earlier iOS versions has been discontinued.)
- **Apple Intelligence fallback** — on supported iPhones, food-description analysis for text, voice-transcribed, and Siri food logs can use Apple Intelligence on-device as the final fallback after BYOK provider/fallback attempts fail.
- **AI optional nutrient goals** — estimate detailed nutrient goals from profile data without changing calorie/protein/carbs/fat formulas.
- **Goal-aware prompt chips** — suggested questions change based on whether your goal is Lose / Gain / Maintain
- **Thermodynamic weight forecast** — expected weight at 30/60/90 days, predicted vs observed weekly change, days-to-goal, under-logging detection. Surfaced through Coach as live context on every turn.
- **Resilient requests** — transient provider overloads (503 / 529 / 429) auto-retry with 1s / 2s / 4s exponential backoff across both food analysis and Coach chat, so short spikes resolve invisibly

### Tracking
- **Expanded nutrients** per entry — macros plus sugar, fiber, fats, cholesterol, sodium, potassium, calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, vitamins, folate, omega-3, and more when available
- **Custom Home nutrient cards** — swap the top cards from protein/carbs/fat to fiber, sodium, vitamin D, calcium, or other tracked nutrients
- **Optional nutrient goals** — set or AI-estimate goals for the non-macro nutrients; these stay separate from the calorie and macro calculator
- **Scrollable week calendar** — swipe to any past week, configurable start day
- **Food log sorting** — keep the default grouped view, or sort meal sections by latest logging order from the Home screen
- **Progress charts** — switch between weight, optional body fat, and calculated workout burn, alongside calorie history and macro averages (1W to All Time)
- **Progress summaries** — weight and body-fat ranges show average and net change for the selected week, month, or longer window
- **Decimal nutrition totals** — macros and detailed nutrients preserve decimal precision in logs, Home, widgets, and View More
- **Weight History** — tap-to-delete past entries and sync supported deletions to Apple Health / Health Connect
- **Goal tracking** — set target weight, BMR/TDEE auto-calculation; goal-reached alert fires from both manual logs and Apple Health reads
- **Adaptive Goals** — weekly calorie correction from observed weight trend; pinned macros stay pinned and unlocked macros auto-balance. On by default for new installs (stays off if you hand-edit your plan during onboarding)
- **Six activity levels** — Sedentary, Light, Moderate, Active, Very Active, and Extra Active use work and training descriptions instead of step-count requirements
- **Custom meal times** — choose when Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, and Snack begin; the app uses those boundaries for automatic meal grouping
- **Optional water tracking** — off by default; set any practical daily goal, quick-log one to three glasses or a custom amount, see progress below calories, and optionally schedule a local reminder
- **Optional fasting tracking** — off by default; choose a 1–168 hour goal, start/end/cancel from the Home + menu, keep an active timer through app restarts, optionally receive a local goal alert, and edit or delete completed sessions without changing nutrition totals

### Workouts
- **Training Programs** — switch between several saved programs; Push, Pull, Legs, Upper, Lower is the priority five-day program
- **Science-ranked substitutions** — every slot has five ranked alternatives based on stable loading, progression, comfortable full or lengthened range of motion, and target-muscle loading
- **16-week progression** — three escalating RIR weeks followed by a two-set deload every fourth week, with per-exercise rep ranges and rest guidance
- **Program-aware nutrition** — the selected program's weekly frequency and volume automatically adjust calorie and protein targets
- **Finnish parity** — exercise names, roles, alternatives, coaching notes, and program controls are available in English and Finnish on both platforms

### Health & platform
- **Apple Health** — bidirectional sync for body measurements, meal nutrition, and calculated workout calories; Siri food/weight logs use the same HealthKit paths, and Energy Burn Goals can estimate calorie targets from active/total energy while macros stay editable
- **Health Connect** — Android sync for nutrition, weight, body fat, and calculated workout calories, with permission reconciliation and backfill support; Energy Burn Goals can use recent energy data for calorie targets
- **Local-only fasting records** — fasting sessions are intentionally not written to Apple Health or Health Connect; eligible OS backup/device transfer may still include them according to device settings
- **Restore after a reinstall** — on a fresh install or new phone, food, weight, body-fat, and calculated workout-burn records previously written by Fud AI can restore from Apple Health / Health Connect; local workout plans and set details require an OS backup/device transfer
- **Optional iCloud / Google Drive Backup** — off until you turn it on in Settings → Data Management; iPhone uses iCloud, Android uses Google Drive after sign-in at that toggle only; restore keeps original Health IDs so samples are not duplicated
- **Apple Watch** — watchOS app and complications show calories, macros, and compact water progress when water tracking is enabled
- **Widgets** — iOS offers Ruoka + Treeni in Small, Medium, and Large, small Protein, and a separate small/Lock Screen Water widget; Android offers Calorie, Protein, Today, and Water Glance widgets that update from local snapshots
- **Theme color** — iOS and Android Settings let users change the app accent, with matching home screen / launcher icons
- **Languages** — iOS and Android support 19 languages: Arabic, Azerbaijani, Czech, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Romanian, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, Ukrainian. The app auto-selects by the phone's Language setting.
- **Meal reminders** — customizable breakfast, lunch, dinner notifications
- **Dark mode** — system, light, or dark
- **Metric & imperial** units

## AI Providers

Pick any of the **13 LLM providers** for food analysis, meal what-if suggestions, optional nutrient-goal estimation, and Coach chat. Free Gemini keys are available at [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey). Requests go directly from your device to the provider you configure. For text, voice-transcribed, and Siri food descriptions on supported iPhones, Apple Intelligence can run on-device only as the last fallback after BYOK provider/fallback attempts fail.

| Provider | Format | Highlight | Needs API Key |
|----------|--------|-----------|:---:|
| Google Gemini | Gemini API | Gemini 3.5 Flash-Lite (default) / 3.6 Flash / 3.5 Flash | Yes |
| OpenAI | OpenAI | GPT-5.4 Mini (default) / 5.5 / 5.4 Nano | Yes |
| Anthropic Claude | Messages API | Sonnet 5 (default) / Opus 4.8 / Haiku 4.5 | Yes |
| xAI Grok | OpenAI-compatible | Grok 4.3 | Yes |
| OpenRouter | OpenAI-compatible | Any model, free-form IDs | Yes |
| Together AI | OpenAI-compatible | Qwen 3.5, Gemma 4, MiniMax M3 | Yes |
| Groq | OpenAI-compatible | Qwen 3.6, very fast | Yes |
| Hugging Face | OpenAI-compatible | Gemma 4 / 3 and Qwen 3.5 / 2.5 VL (open-weight router, free-form IDs) | Yes |

| Custom (OpenAI-compatible) | OpenAI-compatible | You set base URL + free-form model name | Optional |

## Speech-to-Text Providers

Pick how voice input is transcribed. Native iOS / Android is the default — free, on-device where supported, real-time. On Android, native speech first tries the on-device language path, then falls back to Android recognition with network/provider defaults if the phone lacks offline support for that language. Each provider has its own language setting: use Provider Auto, Use Device Language, or an explicit language hint where supported.

| Provider | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| Native iOS / Android (On-Device) | Free, offline where the phone supports the selected language, real-time partial results |
| Gemini Audio | Batch audio transcription through Gemini for BYOK users |
| OpenAI Whisper | Whisper-1 via `/v1/audio/transcriptions` |
| Groq (Whisper) | Whisper-large-v3, very fast, has a free tier |
| Deepgram | Nova-3, fast and accurate |
| AssemblyAI | Universal model, strong accuracy, free tier |

For Android phones where native speech is inconsistent, Groq (Whisper) or Deepgram are recommended alternatives; the developer currently uses Groq.

API keys are stored encrypted on-device: **iOS Keychain** on iOS and **EncryptedSharedPreferences backed by Android Keystore** on Android.

For the Coach chat, every turn builds a slim system prompt from your live profile, BMR formula in use, computed forecast, today's date/timezone, and a one-line snapshot of available data. Coach then pulls relevant ranges of weight, body fat, calorie totals, food entries, workouts, or explicitly logged fasting sessions on demand via tool calling — ask "what was my weight in March?" or "how did my completed fasts line up with training this week?" and it fetches only the slice it needs. Coach never infers fasting from gaps in the food log.

## Calorie & Macro Calculation

The app calculates personalized daily targets using established nutrition science formulas:

| Step | Formula | Details |
|------|---------|---------|
| **BMR** | Katch-McArdle | `370 + 21.6 × lean mass (kg)` — used when body fat % is known |
| **BMR** | Mifflin-St Jeor | `10w + 6.25h − 5a ± 5` — fallback when body fat is unknown |
| **TDEE** | BMR × activity | Multiplier ranges from 1.2 (sedentary) to 1.9 (extra active) |
| **Daily Calories** | TDEE + adjustment | Adjustment = `weeklyChangeKg × 7700 / 7` (deficit or surplus) |
| **Protein** | Activity + goal | `0.8 – 2.2 g/kg` body weight by activity, plus +0.2 g/kg during cutting phase (Helms et al 2014); when body fat % is known, Activity Level also shows the equivalent g/kg lean-mass multiplier |
| **Fat** | Fixed ratio | `0.6 g/kg` body weight |
| **Carbs** | Auto-balanced | Remainder from calories − protein − fat (any macro can be pinned; max 2 pinned) |

All values can be manually overridden in Settings, with a **Recalculate Goals** button to snap back to formula defaults.

## Architecture

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Language** | Swift 5, SwiftUI, iOS 17.6+ |
| **Storage** | UserDefaults (local JSON), Keychain (API keys) |
| **AI** | `GeminiService` for food + label analysis, `ChatService` for multi-turn Coach chat, both route across all 13 providers |
| **Speech** | Native `SFSpeechRecognizer` / Android `SpeechRecognizer` or remote providers via `SpeechService` (m4a upload) |
| **Health** | HealthKit / Health Connect read-write paths for body measurements, meal nutrition, and calculated workout calories, with UUID-tagged samples for safe delete |
| **Pattern** | `@Observable` + `.environment()`, main actor isolation |
| **Localization** | `Localizable.xcstrings` (String Catalog), 18 iOS languages, auto-selected by iPhone's system language |
| **Dependencies** | Native platform frameworks; detailed app data and API keys remain local, with only opt-in Weekly Challenge profile/aggregate fields sent to Fud AI |

## Build & Run

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/apoorvdarshan/fud-ai.git
cd fud-ai
```

### iOS

```bash
xcodebuild -project ios/calorietracker.xcodeproj \
  -scheme calorietracker \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' build
```

Open `ios/calorietracker.xcodeproj` in Xcode, select your device, and run.

### Android

Open `android/` in Android Studio (Narwhal or newer), let Gradle sync, hit ▶ Run. Or from the CLI:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home"
cd android
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb shell am start -n com.apoorvdarshan.calorietracker/.MainActivity
```

First launch walks you through onboarding (gender, birthday, height/weight with metric/imperial toggle, body fat %, one of six activity levels with a protein-target preview, goal, goal speed, notifications, Apple Health / Health Connect, AI access setup, and review). A free Gemini key is available at [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey). You can change provider anytime in **Settings → AI Access**.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines. Bug reports and feature requests welcome.

Adding a new translation? Open `ios/calorietracker/Localizable.xcstrings` in Xcode and fill in your language column — everything else is already wired.

## Code of Conduct

Everyone in the Fud AI community is expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Report concerns to **apoorv@fud-ai.app**.

## Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Use [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/apoorvdarshan/fud-ai/security/advisories/new) for sensitive issues.

## Privacy

The core tracker has no required account, general Fud AI-operated cloud sync, or analytics. BYOK API keys are protected by iOS Keychain or Android EncryptedSharedPreferences, and requests go directly to the provider you choose. Food, weight, body-fat, water, fasting, and workout logs, custom meal times, goals, preferences, cached images, and widget/Watch snapshots are local except for OS backup/device transfer and the specific AI/STT, barcode, health-sync, update-check, export, or sharing action you initiate. Workout exercise illustrations are downloaded on demand from Fud AI's static asset CDN (`assets.fud-ai.app`) the first time you open an exercise (a plain image request with no account or device identifier) and cached on the device; if the CDN is unreachable the app shows the exercise icon instead. The sole first-party aggregate-sync exception is the optional 18+ Weekly Challenge: enrolled participants share a chosen display name, optional X/Instagram handle, stable participant ID, and bounded weekly overall/activity/nutrition/consistency/hydration aggregates; raw food/workout logs, body data, and photos never sync to it. Challenge leaderboards require a participant credential, and leaving remotely deletes the profile while inactive profiles auto-delete after 90 days. When Coach is used, it may send explicitly logged fasting context to your selected AI provider, but it never infers fasting from missing meals. Shared meal links carry the selected meal details in the URL, so anyone with the link can read them. Apple Health / Health Connect access is optional and can be reviewed or revoked through Manage Access; fasting is not synced to either health store. **Delete All Data** wipes the current local installation and requests challenge deletion when enrolled and online, but never removes Apple Health, Health Connect, or older OS backups.
